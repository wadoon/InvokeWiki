<div>
	<p>This is a fragment of text loaded via AJAX.  It has some simple <strong>HTML</strong>, a bit of <span style="color: red;">formatting</span>,
	and that's about it...</p>
	<p>It's being loaded into a more narrow lightbox, so it will cause scrolling if the text takes up too much space, so lets give it a bunch more
	content so that happens.  Otherwise, we won't get to see the scroll bars.</p>
	<p>Happy now?</p>
</div>
